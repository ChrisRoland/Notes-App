A simple and intuitive Notes App built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, designed to provide a distraction-free note-taking experience. The app leverages localStorage to save and persist user notes, allowing you to access them even after closing the browser. With a clean UI and markdown support, it's perfect for quick thoughts or detailed notes.

- **Markdown Support**: Render notes in markdown format using the marked library for a rich text experience.
- **Persistent Storage**: Notes are saved locally in localStorage to ensure your work is not lost.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for a variety of screen sizes with a clean and modern interface.
- **Delete Notes**: Quickly remove notes you no longer need.

## Technologies Used
